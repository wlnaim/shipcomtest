# shipcomtest

In order to run the project you just need to create the database and modify the connection strings to point to your server and use your credentials.
The application will create the table and populate with the base data on the first usage if no data is preloaded.

You can see a working instance of this code at: https://shipcomtest.azurewebsites.net/

Regards.

P.S. You can use the provided SQL Server instance and database that I already created on Azure temporary, it will only work until June 18th. After that
date the database, credentials and server will be deleted from the resource group.
